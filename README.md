# 🚀 Career Overhaul 2025–2026: From SDET → AI Backend Developer → Architect

Welcome to my **public career transformation repository** — a structured, documented journey to transition from a Senior SDET role into a full-fledged **AI Backend Developer** and, ultimately, **Software Architect**.

This repository contains everything: my weekly progress tracker, resource map, learning notes, and the production-grade AI and backend projects I’m building along the way.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

After 8+ years in automation and QA engineering, I’m evolving my technical depth to focus on **building, scaling, and architecting backend + AI systems**.

This repo serves 3 goals:
1. **Accountability:** Transparent, weekly progress toward my goal.
2. **Showcase:** Real, deployable projects demonstrating backend and AI expertise.
3. **Branding:** Proof of consistency and deep learning — not just skill listing.

## 🗓️ Roadmap Overview

| Phase | Timeline | Focus Area | Key Outcome |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Nov–Dec 2025 | Python Backend Mastery | Production-grade FastAPI apps + CI/CD |
| 2 | Jan–Feb 2026 | LLM & RAG Systems | AI-driven APIs with embeddings & vector DBs |
| 3 | Mar–Apr 2026 | AI Agents & Architecture | Agent-based microservices, observability |
| 4 | May–Jun 2026 | Architect-Level System | Scalable AI platform + AWS deployment |

Each phase is broken into weekly sprints with deliverables — tracked in `00_Weekly_Tracker.md`.

## 💻 Current Focus — November 2025
**Phase 1: Backend Foundations**

- Mastering FastAPI, async design, and clean architecture.
- Building a scalable **Task Tracker API** with:
  - CRUD + JWT Auth  
  - Dockerized deployment  
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD  
  - AWS EC2 hosting  
- Publishing weekly commits and architecture notes.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

> “Depth compounds. Build systems that last, not scripts that pass.”

- Focus on **conceptual depth** before tooling.  
- Build and deploy **every concept** you learn.  
- No skipping weeks — public accountability is the guardrail.
